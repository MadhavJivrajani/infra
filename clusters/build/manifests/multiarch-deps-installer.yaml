#
# This DaemonSet installs the necessary dependencies for building multiarch
# Docker images. To build for example an arm64 Docker image on an x86 machine,
# qemu needs to emulate the ARM architecture. Also, Docker 19.03+ is required.
#
# Not having these dependencies preset results in errors like
#
#   process exited with error: fork/exec /bin/sh: no such file or directorysubprocess exited with status 1
#   process exited with error: fork/exec /bin/sh: exec format errorsubprocess exited with status 1
